title: About me
---

My name is Borys Smejda. I am a passionate C++ developer,
I love reading about new features being added to the language
and listening about the best practices.

In my spare time, I love reading. I read almost everything, ranging from
geopolitics through history up to new technologies.
Apart from that, I always try to keep moving forward and develop my skills.
I really appreciate the value of the sporting activites. I love swimming
and riding a bike. I also love volleyball and football.


### My story

To be honest, I have no idea why I started this all. Having read the Bill Gates' book
"How to Avoid a Climate Disaster", I felt that I need to find a way to somehow preserve
the knowledge I acquired. My first thought was a piece of paper and notes,
but I knew that I would never reach for it again.
A blog seems a much better option as I will have it always by me.
I hope that if you know me personally, you will not cringe when reading.
